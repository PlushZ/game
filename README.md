***Involve en empover citicans to contrubte to science***


## Welcome!

Welcome! :tada: Willkommen! :balloon: Gr√ºezi! :confetti_ball: Bienvenue! :balloon::balloon::balloon:

Thank you for visiting the online microbiome data analysis project repository.

This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.

## What are we doing?

### The problem

Especially last years public media is using words like words like sequencing, DNA, RNA, mutations, and variants, whitout easy to understand scintific explanations. This leaves the audience not more informed and sometimes even more confused. 
As scientists it is our duty ton not only report but also explain our work in a easy to understand way. 
Technologies like DNA sequencing are getting cheaper and therefore more accessible for various applications, e.g. in personalized medicine. This produces more data. Platforms like Galaxy (Afgan et al, Nucl Acids Res , 2018) and the Galaxy training material (Batut et al, Cell syst, 2018) are help scientists allready analyze their own (complex) data in a user friendly way. However, for each analysis there are several ways to perform it. Experience and knowledge helps to achieve good results, but sometimes one has to test several combinations of different algorithms and parameters. This can be exhausting and time consuming. 


### The solution

We belive that the integration of society into the scientific process will help citizens get excite  for science and deepen there understanding.
Further we belive that citizens can also help to collect and impove scintific data and results.
Involving non scientists in this process would help scientists in exploring possibilities of their data analyses. As Galaxy can empower any researchers to analyze their own data, it can also be used to let citizens do their own data analysis and help researchers in their data analysis exploration. With this grant,  we aim to implement a data analysis online game. This game will guide citizens in scientific advancements and help researchers optimize their data analysis results.
We aim to implement an encouraging and easy-to-understand online game where participants impersonate a scientist that helps an alien to learn and perform metagenomic data analyses. The game, implemented in Galaxy, will consist of several levels. As a start, or beginner level, participants learn in an interactive and fun way about the biological background, in particular DNA and sequencing and how to use the platform. In the intermediate level, they perform their first BeerDEcoded data analysis. In both levels participants collect points by answering questions or finding treasures after collecting hints. In the next level participants are guided to change and improve their pipeline for data analysis, using different datasets, tools and parameter combinations, and compare their results. They will gain points for each analysis they run, but also for the quality of their results. Within the last level, participants gain additional points by evaluating and ranking the results of others.

## Who are we?

We are the [Street Science Community](https://streetscience.community), a group of researchers and teachers in Freiburg trying to bring DNA, sequencing, metagenomics and in general the scientific process closer to citizens. Therefore, we already developed the BeerDEcoded project: a series of hands-on workshops for pupils and citizens with the general aim of scientific outreach. During these workshops, we guide participants through the scientific project of the extraction and identification of different yeasts contained in a beer sample. The citicans are prefoming the wohl prosess from opening the beer bottle to the last klick while preforming the datanalysis.
We generated protocols that lead the citicans thought the extracted yeast DNA, the identification via sequencing the, and analyzing the sequenced DNA via an easy and straightforward user interface. Our aim is to makes science tangible and accessible for everyone. 


## What do we need?

**You**! In whatever way you can help.

We are seaching for motivated student in computer science, which can possibliy be payed via a Hiwi contract. 
We also want to work closly with the Galaxy community, to get ideas for the implementaion ideas an typs.
We would like to get hints and insparation from teachers and storytellers to impove the appiel of our game for useres. 
And of corse any direct feedback of a non-researcher's opinion of the usability and gaming factor.

## Get involved

If you think you can help in any of the areas listed above (and we bet you can) or in any of the many areas that we haven't yet thought of (and here we're *sure* you can) then please check out our [contributors' guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [roadmap](../../issues/1).

Please note that it's very important to us that we maintain a positive and supportive environment for everyone who wants to participate. When you join us we ask that you follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions both on and offline.


## Contact us

If you want to report a problem or suggest an enhancement we'd love for you to [open an issue](../../issues) at this github repository because then we can get right on it.
