### Metagenomics

- Now Sam knows enough to work with samples of different creatures. 
- Since he is on earth, he can collect a variety of samples and analyze them. 
- Nevertheless, they are all inextricably linked to their surroundings. 
- A clear sample of one organism is impossible to obtain.
- It looks like a meta genome.
- Luckily there is a solution because Sam sees that there is metagenomics. 
- The metagenomics is the type of genetic analyses focused on DNA samples extracted from the environment.

### Metagenomics

![Metagenimics process is presented. There are four pictures: space, soil, water, tissues. From all four pictures there are arrows to the test tubes. Then the arrow leads to the table describing the samples. Next, to the DNA picture. Then, to the sequencing machine. Then, to the computer.](images/metagenomics2.png)

- There are several steps in the metagenomics process, including collecting samples, DNA sequencing, assembly, classifying, annotation, and analysis.
- As you can see in the picture, it is possible to collect samples from different environments - soil, water, the human gut, and even from another planet, such as Sam's planet.
- The samples are sent to a laboratory for DNA extraction and sequencing.
- After obtaining these sequences they can be processed using various technical tools. 
- The sequences are identified by assembling, classifying and annotating them. 
- Afterwards they can be further analyzed.

### Metagenomics

???
- Places like soil, air, water, parts of living organisms, and other places can be used as sources of samples.
- Once samples are collected, the second step is DNA sequencing. In this step, short DNA reads can be obtained.

### Metagenomics

<small><small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_assembly]</small></small>

???
- The first step is assembly, in which short reads are made longer by using different assembly algorithms. 
- This longer sequence is called “contigs”.

### Metagenomics

???
- Classifying (or binning) is the second step. 
- Each contig can be assigned to the most appropriate genome.
- At the third step, annotation, the previous step's data will be used to annotate the data.
- Genes can be predicted. 
- Species can be identified.

???
- As soon as Sam completes the previous three steps of metagenomics he is going to proceed to the fourth step.
- The fourth step is analysis, last but not least. 
- The experts use different tools to analyze data and draw conclusions to answer their research questions.
- After learning about existing metagenomic analysis tools Sam starts analyzing the data.
- It is incredible since he sees different colorful graphs that visually reflect information about the data.
