???
- On this planet I see the Earth and understand that there are different materials, creatures and forms of life on the earth's surface. 
- Everything that can be found on the earth's surface seems to be connected in one way or the other. 
- Soil, water, air, plants, animals and humans are parts of it.
- I find life in all kinds of forms and understands that organisms are different. 
- But where do these differences come from?
- Why are do small and big organisms exist?
- And what makes all these big and tiny organisms different? 
- I find the answer in the thought that to survive, an organism or animal must adapt well to its environment. 
- If an animal eats insects, they must hunt for them. 
- Their body must have tools for this, such as a beak. 
- Other creatures, such as lizards, have a greenish and brownish body color in order to avoid falling prey to predators.
- Therefore, diverse creatures have different colors and shapes.

???
- These differences are probably a matter of trial and error, and the winners are those who survive long enough to produce offspring. 
- And their offspring will also go through the same trial and error process.
- It could only take one generation with one mutation, which provides some survival benefits, in order to make the leap that will ensure the existence of this animal in the population.

<small><small>[http://www.vce.bioninja.com.au/aos-4-change-over-time/evolution/evolutionary-theories.html]</small></small>

???
- There are two popular theories about evolution - Lamarck’s and Darwin’s.
- Their theories are different because Lamarck thought that organisms changed out of need and after a change in the environment.
- On the other hand, Darwin thought organisms changed by chance when they were born and before there was a change in the environment.
- For example, let’s consider a giraffe's long neck.
- Why is this neck so long?
- Lamarck's theory suggested that the giraffe's original short-necked ancestor repeatedly stretched its neck to reach the higher branches to eat.

<small><small>[http://www.vce.bioninja.com.au/aos-4-change-over-time/evolution/evolutionary-theories.html]</small></small>

???
- Darwin's theory suggests that a giraffe was born with a longer neck by random chance. 
- Long necked and short necked giraffes once existed together, but the long-necked giraffe had an adaptive advantage.
- Having access to more food allowed the giraffe to live longer and reproduce more, ultimately leading to more long-neck giraffes.

???
- Connecting this first information that I learned I realize all life on earth is related. 
- In other words, if I could travel back in time, I could find a common genetic ancestor for any two organisms on earth. 
- It does not matter how different they seem. 
- Even humans and bananas, which humans eat for breakfast, share a distant ancestor. 
- It may seem shocking. 
- But when comparing a human genome to a banana genome, there are so many genes that are similar within the two organisms. 
- Although, from the outside they appear to be very different organisms. 
- Thinking about what humans do for living and what a banana does, there's a lot of things they do in the same way, like consuming oxygen. 
- A lot of genes are just fundamental to life.
- Since I already learned this, it is not so shocking for me that humans and bananas share the same ancestor.

### Introduction to the biology

![The image of the tree of life is still in the drawing process](images/tree-of-life.png)

???
- An ancestor carries genetic information that is still shared by all creatures on earth. 
- A way to showcase relationships of different species to each other is called a phylogenetic tree. 
- These trees can depict hypothetical relationships and traits of organisms, genes, or even proteins. 
- A specific form trying to showcase all living organisms is the tree of life.
- At the base of the tree trunk lies that ancestor, the first living organism on this planet. 
- Through the evolution of life over the last 3.8 billion years, new species have emerged, resulting in entire lineages of organisms.
- Every branching point in that tree is a story of remarkable adaptation to an ever-changing world.
- The goal of the tree of life is: try to understand how every species is related to each other. 
- And it's fascinating!

<a href=" https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/labs//lab/evolution/research#/chooser">Build-a-tree: Evolution Puzzle Game</a> <br>
Click the button "Play" under the "Mission 1. Training trees". <br>
And then, click “Play” again under “Red, green, and gecko” and enjoy!

???
- Now you have this option to play and learn. 
- In this game, you'll climb around the tree of life, building out parts of it to better understand how evolution works, and why it matters to you.
- In this game you'll start with one branch which represents a single species like human beings, or cushion see stars. 
- The top of this branch contains all organisms of these species, like all people, or all cushion sea stars. 
- If you travel along the branch back in time you come to a common ancestor of these species.
- Let's roll time forward instead. 
- The split point represents the evolutionary moment when the common ancestor of these species diverged into two specific species.
- Along the time you get more splitting, more species and more biodiversity. 
- Until you get a tree.
- You'll be organising the collection of species into a tree. 
- You can search for more information about species using the "magnifying glass" button, or searching more on the Internet. 
- After you gather the information you need, build a tree by drugging species icons and then traits into the center of the screen.
- In general, the more closely related the species the more traits they share. 
- Deeper branch points connect species that are more distantly related and have fewer traits in common.
- Click the button "Play" under the "Mission 1 - Training trees".
- And then, click “Play” again under “Red, green, and gecko” and enjoy!
- For our purpose it's enough to play only “Red, green, and gecko”.

<small><small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(biology)#/media/File:Two_domain_tree.png]</small></small>

???
- I see that the tree of life can be structured. 
- I figure out that creatures belong to various domains in the tree of life. 
- Domains are a concept of grouping creatures. 
- Prokaryotic organisms belong either to the domain Archaea or the domain Bacteria; organisms with eukaryotic cells belong to the domain Eukarya. 
- All domains have DNA as a blueprint of life.
- “Domains” are the top-level classification which categorizes life in the most general way. 
- For example, one difference between the domains is if the DNA is stored in a compartment called nucleus or it just lies in a circular form within the cell.
- Eukaryotes have a nucleus. 
- Apart from nucleus, there are other differences between organisms from diverse domains.
- I am wondering what a nucleus is and where it belongs to.  
- I find out that a nucleus is usually the part of a cell.

### Introduction to the biology

![The cell as the building block of all organisms. The main elements of the cell are nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plasma membrane](images/cell.png)

???
- Cells are the basic building blocks of all living things. 
- It is the smallest unit that can live on its own and that makes up all living organisms. 
- A eukaryotic cell has three main parts: the cell membrane, the nucleus, and the cytoplasm. 
- The cell membrane surrounds the cell and controls the substances that go into and out of the cell. 
- The liquid inside the cell is called cytoplasm. 
- Different compartments of the cell are surrounded by this cytoplasm.
- One of these compartments is the nucleus.
- The nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is also enclosed with a nuclear membrane, and it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material.

<small><small>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWjYS-DNIiQ]</small></small>

???
- I find a cell wonderful and goes back to “domains”.
- I find out that archaea were first classified as bacterias.
- Their appearance from the outside looks closer to bacterias.
- However other properties are closer to the once of eukaryota.
- Therefore, archaea form a separate domain from bacteria. 
- Nevertheless, I do not investigate archaea further because this is a different but also fascinating story. 
- Instead, I focus on bacteria as prokaryotic organisms.

<small><small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)#/media/File:Celltypes.svg]</small></small>

???
- Now it is time for me to learn more about cells of organisms from different domains.
- Cells are of two types: eukaryotic, which for example contain their genetic information enclosed by a membrane called a nucleus.
- Whereas prokaryotic do not have their genetic information enclosed. 
- Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms, while eukaryotes can be either single-celled or multicellular. 
- Moreover, eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles and the cell size is from 10 to 100 micrometres, whereas prokaryotic cell size is smaller - from 0.1 to 5 micrometres.
- Wow, if they are so small how can I look at them?

![Loupe over the globe. Various microorganisms are visible in the magnifying glass of the loupe.](images/earth_under_loupe.png)

???
- As I am so small on its planet, I am particularly interested in discovering small things on earth. 
- Moreover, I am equipped with a special zoom view tool, which is a very useful tool to investigate the diversity of life. 
- My zoom tool works in the same way as a microscope.

### Introduction to the biology

![Sam is holding a control panel, on which there are 3 buttons - an eye, the letter L, the letter E. The letter L corresponds to the light microscope, which is schematically depicted next to the L button.The letter E corresponds to the electron microscope, which is shown next to the E button.](images/sam_and_microscopes.png)

???
- Unlike terrestrial microscopes, my zoom view tool has three settings in one. 
- The first option allows me to see objects which humans can see with their naked eye. 
- The second setting turns on a light microscope-like vision. 
- The light microscope uses lenses and light, so a normal human eye can see something very small in more detail.
- Finally, the third setting makes me able to see objects available for viewing under a terrestrial electron microscope. 
- For objects that are not even visible with a light microscope, an electron microscope can help humans to look at very tiny objects.

### Introduction to the biology

![Logarithmic scale of relative sizes from 0.1 nm to 1 m. The interval from 0.1 to 100 μm corresponds to an electron microscope; an atom, lipids, protein, flu virus, mitochondria, bacteria, plant cell, and animal cell fall into this interval. The section from 10 nm to 10 mm corresponds to a light microscope, this interval includes mitochondria, bacteria, plant cell, animal cell, human egg, and frogs egg. The interval from 100 μm to 1 m corresponds to a naked eye; human egg, frogs egg, chicken egg, ostrich egg, and adult female fall into this interval.](images/micriscope-sizes.png)

<small><small>[https://training.galaxyproject.org/]</small></small>

???
- Light microscopes let us look at objects that are between a millimetre (10-3 m) and  0.2 micrometres (0.2 thousands of a millimetre or 2 x 10-7 m) in size. 
- Whereas, the most powerful electron microscopes allow us to see objects as small as an atom (about one ten-millionth of a millimetre or 1 angstrom or 10-10 m).

![The leaf is on the microscope](images/microscope_leaf.png)

???
- For example, if you are curious what a leaf is made from, the best would be to use a light microscope.

### Introduction to the biology

![The leaf is on the microscope, a zoom from one point on the leaf shows a plant cell](images/microscope_leaf_extended.png)

???
- That is because the cell of a plant is in size between 10 and 100 micrometres. 
- However, if you want to go further to investigate this leaf’s proteins or even atoms which size starting from 1 nanometre, then an electron microscope should be used.

<small><small>[https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/lab-report/microbiome-mashup-scientists-align-to-understand-microbes-and-around-us]</small></small>

???
- Looking at life through these microscope-like visions, I am surprised! 
- It turned out, there are different tiny organisms of different colors, sizes, and shapes.

<small><small>[https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/2018-small-world-in-motion-competition]</small></small>

???
- These organisms are around 1 micrometer in size. 
- They are only visible under a microscope or my microscope-like tool. 
- Thus, they are called microscopic organisms, microbes, or microorganisms.

### Introduction to the biology

![The image of the tree of life is still in the drawing process](images/tree-of-life.png)

???
- At this point I already have so many questions from what I have learnt.
- I ask myself how can one find out where an organism belongs in the tree of life? 
- How is such a tree built? 
- And if there is one common thing called DNA in all creatures on earth, what does this thing look like and work? 
- Let’s explore it with me.
