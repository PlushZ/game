### Introduction to the biology

![А big dog stands and looks at a sitting small dog](images/dogs.png)

<small><small>[http://www.lifesabundance.com/thumbnails/BigLittleDogs.jpg]</small></small>

???
-On this planet Sam sees the Earth and understands that there are different materials, creatures and forms of life on the earth's surface. 
-Everything that can be found on the earth's surface seems to be connected in one way or the other. 
-Soil, water, air, plants, animals and humans are parts of it.
-Sam finds life in all kinds of forms and understands that organisms are different. 
-But where do these differences come from?
-Why are do small and big organisms exist?
-And what makes all these big and tiny organisms different? 
-Sam finds the answer in the thought that to survive, an organism or animal must adapt well to its environment. 
-If an animal eats insects, they must hunt for them. 
-Their body must have tools for this, such as a beak. 
-Other creatures, such as lizards, have a greenish and brownish body color in order to avoid falling prey to predators.
-Therefore, diverse creatures have different colors and shapes.

<small><small>[https://www.faunesauvage.fr/events/journee-mondiale-de-la-vie-sauvage-6]</small></small>

???
-These differences are probably a matter of trial and error, and the winners are those who survive long enough to produce offspring. 
-And their offspring will also go through the same trial and error process.
-It could only take one generation with one mutation, which provides some survival benefits, in order to make the leap that will ensure the existence of this animal in the population.

<small><small>[http://www.vce.bioninja.com.au/aos-4-change-over-time/evolution/evolutionary-theories.html]</small></small>

???
-There are two popular theories about evolution - Lamarck’s and Darwin’s.
-Their theories are different because Lamarck thought that organisms changed out of need and after a change in the environment.
-On the other hand, Darwin thought organisms changed by chance when they were born and before there was a change in the environment.
-For example, let’s consider a giraffe's long neck.
-Why is this neck so long?
-Lamarck's theory suggested that the giraffe's original short-necked ancestor repeatedly stretched its neck to reach the higher branches to eat.

<small><small>[http://www.vce.bioninja.com.au/aos-4-change-over-time/evolution/evolutionary-theories.html]</small></small>

???
-Darwin's theory suggests that a giraffe was born with a longer neck by random chance. 
-Long necked and short necked giraffes once existed together, but the long-necked giraffe had an adaptive advantage.
-Having access to more food allowed the giraffe to live longer and reproduce more, ultimately leading to more long-neck giraffes.

???
-Connecting this first information that Sam learned he realizes all life on earth is related. 
-In other words, if Sam could travel back in time, he could find a common genetic ancestor for any two organisms on earth. 
-It does not matter how different they seem. 
-Even humans and bananas, which humans eat for breakfast, share a distant ancestor. 
-It may seem shocking. 
-But when comparing a human genome to a banana genome, there are so many genes that are similar within the two organisms. 
-Although, from the outside they appear to be very different organisms. 
-Thinking about what humans do for living and what a banana does, there's a lot of things they do in the same way, like consuming oxygen. 
-A lot of genes are just fundamental to life.
-Since Sam already learned this, it is not so shocking for him that humans and bananas share the same ancestor.

### Introduction to the biology

![The image of the tree of life is still in the drawing process](images/tree-of-life.png)

???
-An ancestor carries genetic information that is still shared by all creatures on earth. 
-A way to showcase relationships of different species to each other is called a phylogenetic tree. 
-These trees can depict hypothetical relationships and traits of organisms, genes, or even proteins. 
-A specific form trying to showcase all living organisms is the tree of life.
-At the base of the tree trunk lies that ancestor, the first living organism on this planet. 
-Through the evolution of life over the last 3.8 billion years, new species have emerged, resulting in entire lineages of organisms.
-Every branching point in that tree is a story of remarkable adaptation to an ever-changing world.
-The goal of the tree of life is: try to understand how every species is related to each other. 
- And it's fascinating!

???
-Now you have this option to play and learn. 
-In this game, you'll climb around the tree of life, building out parts of it to better understand how evolution works, and why it matters to you.
-In this game you'll start with one branch which represents a single species like human beings, or cushion see stars. 
-The top of this branch contains all organisms of these species, like all people, or all cushion sea stars. 
-If you travel along the branch back in time you come to a common ancestor of these species.
-Let's roll time forward instead. 
-The split point represents the evolutionary moment when the common ancestor of these species diverged into two specific species.
-Along the time you get more splitting, more species and more biodiversity. 
-Until you get a tree.
-You'll be organising the collection of species into a tree. 
-You can search for more information about species using the "magnifying glass" button, or searching more on the Internet. 
-After you gather the information you need, build a tree by drugging species icons and then traits into the center of the screen.
-In general, the more closely related the species the more traits they share. 
-Deeper branch points connect species that are more distantly related and have fewer traits in common.
-Click the button "Play" under the "Mission 1 - Training trees".
-And then, click “Play” again under “Red, green, and gecko” and enjoy!
-For our purpose it's enough to play only “Red, green, and gecko”.

### Introduction to the biology

![The three-domains tree with bacteria, archaea, eukarya domains.](images/domains0.png)

<small><small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(biology)#/media/File:Two_domain_tree.png]</small></small>

???
-Sam sees that the tree of life can be structured. 
-Sam figures out that creatures belong to various domains in the tree of life. 
-Domains are a concept of grouping creatures. 
-Prokaryotic organisms belong either to the domain Archaea or the domain Bacteria; organisms with eukaryotic cells belong to the domain Eukarya. 
-All domains have DNA as a blueprint of life.
-“Domains” are the top-level classification which categorizes life in the most general way. 
-For example, one difference between the domains is if the DNA is stored in a compartment called nucleus or it just lies in a circular form within the cell.
-Eukaryotes have a nucleus. 
-Apart from nucleus, there are other differences between organisms from diverse domains.
-Sam is wondering what a nucleus is and where it belongs to.  
-He finds out that a nucleus is usually the part of a cell.


---

### Introduction to the biology

![The cell as the building block of all organisms. The main elements of the cell are nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plasma membrane](images/cell.png)

???
-Cells are the basic building blocks of all living things. 
-It is the smallest unit that can live on its own and that makes up all living organisms. 
-A eukaryotic cell has three main parts: the cell membrane, the nucleus, and the cytoplasm. 
-The cell membrane surrounds the cell and controls the substances that go into and out of the cell. 
-The liquid inside the cell is called cytoplasm. 
-Different compartments of the cell are surrounded by this cytoplasm.
-One of these compartments is the nucleus.
-The nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is also enclosed with a nuclear membrane, and it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material.

<small><small>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWjYS-DNIiQ]</small></small>

???
-Sam finds a cell wonderful and goes back to “domains”.
-He finds out that archaea were first classified as bacterias.
-Their appearance from the outside looks closer to bacterias.
-However other properties are closer to the once of eukaryota.
-Therefore, archaea form a separate domain from bacteria. 
-Nevertheless, Sam does not investigate archaea further because this is a different but also fascinating story. 
-Instead, he focuses on bacteria as prokaryotic organisms.

### Introduction to the biology
![Schematic image of a eukaryotic cell and a prokaryotic cell ](images/eukaryote-prokaryote-cell.png)

<small><small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)#/media/File:Celltypes.svg]</small></small>

???
-Now it is time for Sam to learn more about cells of organisms from different domains.
-Cells are of two types: eukaryotic, which for example contain their genetic information enclosed by a membrane called a nucleus.
-Whereas prokaryotic do not have their genetic information enclosed. 
-Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms, while eukaryotes can be either single-celled or multicellular. 
-Moreover, eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles and the cell size is from 10 to 100 micrometres, whereas prokaryotic cell size is smaller - from 0.1 to 5 micrometres.
-Wow, if they are so small how can Sam look at them?

### Introduction to the biology
![Loupe over the globe. Various microorganisms are visible in the magnifying glass of the loupe.](images/earth_under_loupe.png)

???
-As Sam is so small on its planet, he is particularly interested in discovering small things on earth. 
-Moreover, Sam is equipped with a special zoom view tool, which is a very useful tool to investigate the diversity of life. 
-Sam's zoom tool works in the same way as a microscope. 


---

### Introduction to the biology

![Sam is holding a control panel, on which there are 3 buttons - an eye, the letter L, the letter E. The letter L corresponds to the light microscope, which is schematically depicted next to the L button.The letter E corresponds to the electron microscope, which is shown next to the E button.](images/sam_and_microscopes.png)

???
-Unlike terrestrial microscopes, Sam’s zoom view tool has three settings in one. 
-The first option allows Sam to see objects which humans can see with their naked eye. 
-The second setting turns on a light microscope-like vision. 
-The light microscope uses lenses and light, so a normal human eye can see something very small in more detail.
-Finally, the third setting makes Sam able to see objects available for viewing under a terrestrial electron microscope. 
-For objects that are not even visible with a light microscope, an electron microscope can help humans to look at very tiny objects.

### Introduction to the biology

![Logarithmic scale of relative sizes from 0.1 nm to 1 m. The interval from 0.1 to 100 μm corresponds to an electron microscope; an atom, lipids, protein, flu virus, mitochondria, bacteria, plant cell, and animal cell fall into this interval. The section from 10 nm to 10 mm corresponds to a light microscope, this interval includes mitochondria, bacteria, plant cell, animal cell, human egg, and frogs egg. The interval from 100 μm to 1 m corresponds to a naked eye; human egg, frogs egg, chicken egg, ostrich egg, and adult female fall into this interval.](images/micriscope-sizes.png)

<small><small>[https://training.galaxyproject.org/]</small></small>

???
-Light microscopes let us look at objects that are between a millimetre (10-3 m) and  0.2 micrometres (0.2 thousands of a millimetre or 2 x 10-7 m) in size. 
-Whereas, the most powerful electron microscopes allow us to see objects as small as an atom (about one ten-millionth of a millimetre or 1 angstrom or 10-10 m).

-For example, if you are curious what a leaf is made from, the best would be to use a light microscope. 

---

### Introduction to the biology

![The leaf is on the microscope, a zoom from one point on the leaf shows a plant cell](images/microscope_leaf_extended.png)

???
-That is because the cell of a plant is in size between 10 and 100 micrometres. 
-However, if you want to go further to investigate this leaf’s proteins or even atoms which size starting from 1 nanometre, then an electron microscope should be used.

![Three real photos of different microorganisms](images/microorganisms.png)

<small><small>[https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/2018-small-world-in-motion-competition]</small></small>

???
-These organisms are around 1 micrometer in size. 
-They are only visible under a microscope or Sam’s microscope-like tool. 
-Thus, they are called microscopic organisms, microbes, or microorganisms.

???
-At this point Sam already has so many questions from what he has learnt.
-Sam asks himself how can one find out where an organism belongs in the tree of life? 
-How is such a tree built? 
-And if there is one common thing called DNA in all creatures on earth, what does this thing look like and work? 
-Let’s explore it with Sam.

### DNA

![DNA double helix](images/dna1.png)

<small><small>[https://nebula.org/blog/de/dna-desoxyribonukleinsaeure/]</small></small>

???
-DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. 
-DNA is the material that carries all the information about how an organism will look and function. 
-For instance, DNA determines such things as color and shape of an organism and how this organism breathes. 
-All such information is encoded in DNA. 
-Each piece of information is carried on a different section of the DNA. 
-These sections are called genes.
-Our DNA is also called genetic information or the building plan of life.

### DNA

![Schematic image of a DNA inside a chromosome, a chromosome inside a nucleus, a nucleus inside a cell](images/chromosome.png)

<small><small>[https://www.yourgenome.org/video/from-dna-to-protein-flash]</small></small>

???
-After learning that DNA exists, Sam is eager to see this magical thing which carries all the information describing living organisms. 
-Since he already knows how tiny it is, he uses his electron microscope vision. 
-The most exciting thing he finds in eukaryotic organisms. 
-It turns out that DNA in eukaryotes is found in structures of the cell called chromosomes. 
-Chromosomes are thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of cells. 
-Each chromosome packs a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). 
-For the packing processes little helpers, called protein, are needed.
-They are part of the chromosome and situated around the packed DNA.

### DNA

![Three double strands of DNA, one of which is affected by a mutation](images/dna-with-mutation.png)

<small><small>[https://www.clinicalomics.com/topics/translational-research/natural-suppressor-mutations-may-help-protect-us-from-genetic-disorders/]</small></small>

???
-DNA is the blueprint of life, because it includes the instructions needed for an organism to grow, develop, live, and reproduce.
-Proteins are little ‘work horses’, which the cells need for carrying out its function. 
-The genes in DNA transmit physical characteristics from parents to their heirs.
-DNA is a chain of chemical units found in each cell of a living creature. 
-The chemical units are arranged in a particular sequence.  
-Sometimes changes with one unit of the DNA can happen. 
-This is called a mutation. 
-Some of the mutations can have no consequences at all but others can cause diseases and other problems. 
-Mutations are also very important for evolution. 
-A mutation could lead to a better adjustment to a certain condition, like hot weather.

### DNA

![Two persons are holding nucleotides and building DNA  from them](images/dna-builders.png)

<small><small>[https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/312648399128435797/]</small></small>

???
-Sam begins to learn about the structure of DNA and sees it is complex.
-It is composed of chemicals that are linked together like a chain. 
-Each piece of DNA has two long strands, or chains. 
-The two strands are connected together. 
-They form a shape like a ladder that has been twisted into a spiral.
-Chemicals called phosphates and sugars make up the sides of the ladder, the so-called backbone. 
-There are other  chemical compounds called bases, which bind together, and would form the steps in a ladder.
-Each base on one strand is joined to a base on the second strand.

---

### DNA

![DNA double helix consists of four types of nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine.](images/nucleotides.png)

<small><small>[https://www.the-scientist.com/daily-news/base-editing-now-able-to-convert-adenine-thymine-to-guanine-cytosine-30706]</small></small>

???
-Sam sees that the bases look a bit different
-He identifies four different bases in DNA: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. 
-These chemicals are called nucleotides and they are repeated in different orders over and over again in each strand of DNA. 
-The order in which the bases are arranged is very important. 
-It forms a code that tells cells to make certain kinds of proteins. 
-The differences in these proteins is what makes different living creatures—such as a yeast, a mouse, or two different people.

### Sequencing

![Tetris game, as a result of which DNA is built from small pieces](images/dna-tetris.png)

<small><small>[https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/107664247327936161/]</small></small>

???
-In Sam's mind, he is wondering: can it be determined in which order the nucleotides occur in every type of organism? 
-When you have a small piece of material from a specific organism, can you identify the sequence of its bases?
-An automated system would be clever, because reading the whole DNA of e.g. a human which has 6.4 billion letters would take Sam too much time.


---

### Sequencing

![Papers with the words "horse", "man", "gorilla" are attached to three strings of beads.](images/sequencing1.png)

<small><small>[https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/10485011602449279/]</small></small>

???
-After some research, he realizes that a technique for determining this order already exists. 
-This technique is called DNA sequencing.
-And using sequencing one can determine if a DNA stretch originates from a house human or gorilla just by reading out the sequences of the bases.

---

### Sequencing

![One DNA and four hands with four different nucleotides](images/dna-4-hands.png)

<small><small>[https://www.pinterest.ru/pin/88453580171419743/]</small></small>
???
-As Sam already knows that there are four different bases in DNA. 
-As if it was constructed by 4 different hands.
-DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleic acid sequence – the order of these different nucleotides in DNA. 
-It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine.

---

### Sequencing

![Portrait of Sanger](images/sanger.png)

<small><small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Sanger]</small></small>

???
-The first person who determined the sequence was Frederick Sanger. 
-In the 50’s he determined the sequence of amino acids in a protein. 
-He showed the order of the 51 amino acids (the small building blocks of proteins) of the insulin protein, which was never done before.

---

### Sequencing

![Chain termination method](images/dna-sequencing_med.png)

<small><small>[https://www.starseq.com/life-science/sanger-sequencing/]</small></small>

???
-A bit later, in the early 70’s Sanger developed a method to determine the exact sequence of nucleotides within a gene. 
-This method is called the “chain termination” method. 
-In the same year, another chemical method of DNA sequencing was explained by Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert. 
-The “chain termination” method is still used in laboratories today for smaller stretches of sequences.
-However, nowadays there are cheaper and less time consuming methods.

---

### Sequencing

![Sequencing timeline from the first generation sequencing (e.g. Sanger chain-termination) to the second generation (e.g. Illumina), and then to the third generation (e.g. Oxford Nanopore)](images/sequencing-generation-timeline.png)

<small><small>https://www.pacb.com/blog/the-evolution-of-dna-sequencing-tools/</small></small>

???
-Sam is impressed by the timeline of the development of sequencing.
-The Sanger method is tedious and time-consuming. 
-Other methods were developed afterwards such as Illumina sequencing, the so-called second-generation method and later around 2014 nanopore-based DNA sequencing, the so-called third generation sequencing.

### Sequencing

![Image of cell membrane with an embedded protein with central pore. DNA is shown entering the pore, an electrical signal comes out](images/nanopore.png)

<small><small>[https://www.genengnews.com/gen-edge/nanopore-sequencing-the-long-and-winding-road/]</small></small>

???
-Nanopore sequencing is one of the latest methods of DNA sequencing.
-It was developed by Oxford Nanopore and represents a new generation of high throughput  sequencing technology. 
-It measures the change in voltage when the DNA is transported across a membrane through a tiny pore. 
-In this picture there are few components: membrane depicted in gray, nanopore in blue, motor-protein in purple, and the DNA strand in light blue.
-A membrane has a simple structure in which proteins can be incorporated.
-The incorporated protein is called nanopore.
-There is a small hole inside this nanopore the size of a nanometer (hence the name nanopore), such that a DNA strand can pass through this hole.
-The basic idea of nanopore sequencing is that in the channel of nanopore there is not so much space.
-Therefore, how much exactly the DNA blocks this channel depends on the nucleotide sequence.

<small><small>[https://streetscience.community/protocols/beer-dna-sequencing/#sequencing]</small></small>

???
-When the DNA binds to a motor protein, Sam jumps to a motor protein.
-The motor protein is used to move DNA forward. 
-In other words, it is an engine which reduces the speed of DNA passing through nanopore.
-It is important to slow down the DNA strand because, otherwise, the electrical signal would be distorted by combining signals of several nucleotides.
-Sitting on the motor protein Sam starts his wonderful journey while the motor protein looks for a nanopore.
-The motor protein is fixed to the nanopore and then opens the double strand DNA, directing one strand through the nanopore in which bases are read one by one.

<small><small>[https://streetscience.community/protocols/beer-dna-sequencing/#sequencing]</small></small>

???
-Sam jumps to the DNA strand because he is curious what is happening with this moving strand.
-When it passes through, the tension on this pore is changed.
-The change in this voltage is specific for each of the four nucleobases and for Sam, whereby the sequence can be recognized.

### Sequencing

![The device MinION is connected to the laptop.](images/nanopore-device.png)

???
-A special feature of the offered Nanopore devices is their size. 
-Most of these devices are the size of a Mars bar and can also be connected directly to a computer. 
-In this picture there is a portable real-time device for sequencing called MinION connected to a computer for direct transfer of sequencing data for further analysis.
-Sample preparation can be simplified so that sequencing can also take place outside of a laboratory.

-Sam can compare sequences by alignment. 
-Sequence alignment is an arrangement of two or more sequences, highlighting their similarity.
-Comparing the sequences it could be that one of the sequences has a different nucleotide in one position. 
-This is called a Mismatch like the C to T in the red box.
-It could also happen that there is no nucleotide in the second sequence to the one in the first like the G in the blue box. This is called a gap.
-Mismatches in the alignment correspond to mutations, and gaps correspond to insertions or deletions.

???
-Alignment is an important instrument for finding a similarity between two or more sequences
-Due to its semi-conservative duplication mechanism, DNA transmits genetic information from generation to generation. 
-Changes in the material are sometimes caused by errors or mutations in duplication, or by viruses and other mechanisms that move sequences between individuals and within chromosomes. 
-Alignment between sequences indicates that both sequences originated from a common ancestor that contained the matching subsequences. 
-In the case of genetic sequences, it implies that their carriers evolved from a common ancestor.

-Now Sam knows enough to work with samples of different creatures. 
-Since he is on earth, he can collect a variety of samples and analyze them. 
-Nevertheless, they are all inextricably linked to their surroundings. 
-A clear sample of one organism is impossible to obtain.
-It looks like a meta genome.
-Luckily there is a solution because Sam sees that there is metagenomics. 
-The metagenomics is the type of genetic analyses focused on DNA samples extracted from the environment.

### Metagenomics

![Metagenimics process is presented. There are four pictures: space, soil, water, tissues. From all four pictures there are arrows to the test tubes. Then the arrow leads to the table describing the samples. Next, to the DNA picture. Then, to the sequencing machine. Then, to the computer.](images/metagenomics2.png)

???
-There are several steps in the metagenomics process, including collecting samples, DNA sequencing, assembly, classifying, annotation, and analysis.
-As you can see in the picture, it is possible to collect samples from different environments - soil, water, the human gut, and even from another planet, such as Sam's planet.
-The samples are sent to a laboratory for DNA extraction and sequencing.
-After obtaining these sequences they can be processed using various technical tools. 
-The sequences are identified by assembling, classifying and annotating them. 
-Afterwards they can be further analyzed.

???
-Places like soil, air, water, parts of living organisms, and other places can be used as sources of samples.
-Once samples are collected, the second step is DNA sequencing. In this step, short DNA reads can be obtained.

### Metagenomics

![Reads that coincide with individual parts of each other and make up contigs](images/contigs.png)

<small><small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_assembly]</small></small>

???
-The first step is assembly, in which short reads are made longer by using different assembly algorithms. 
-This longer sequence is called “contigs”.

### Metagenomics

![Contigs are assigned to specific labels.](images/binning.png)

<small><small>[https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2019/recovering-rep-genomes-from-mgs.html]</small></small>

???
-Classifying (or binning) is the second step. 
-Each contig can be assigned to the most appropriate genome.
-At the third step, annotation, the previous step's data will be used to annotate the data.
-Genes can be predicted. 
-Species can be identified.

### Metagenomics

![Sam is in front of computer screen on which there is a pie-chart.](images/sam-and-graph.png)


???
-As soon as Sam completes the previous three steps of metagenomics he is going to proceed to the fourth step.
-The fourth step is analysis, last but not least. 
-The experts use different tools to analyze data and draw conclusions to answer their research questions.
-After learning about existing metagenomic analysis tools Sam starts analyzing the data.
-It is incredible since he sees different colorful graphs that visually reflect information about the data.
