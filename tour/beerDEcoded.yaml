      What is a beer microbiome? There are collections of small living
      creatures. These small creatures are called bacteria and they are
      everywhere. In our gut, in the soil, even on vending machines. Some of
      these bacteria are actually very good for us. And some others can make us
      very ill. Bacteria come in different shapes and sizes but they have the
      same components. One crucial component is the DNA, the blueprint of life.
      The DNA encodes the shape and size and many other things unique for a
      bacterial species. Because of the encoding information the DNA can be used
      to identify what kind of bacteria the DNA is from. Therefore, within a
      sample form soil, our gut or beer one can specify what kind of species are
      inside the sample. Follow this tour to learn more about this kind of
      analysis. <br><br> Read and Follow the instructions before clicking

  - title: <b>Assign taxonomic classifications</b>
    content: >-
      One of the key steps in metagenomic data analysis is to identify the taxon
      to which the individual reads belong. Taxonomic classification tools are
      based on microbial genome databases to identify the origin of each
      sequence.<br>
    backdrop: true
  - title: <b>Taxonomic classification with Kraken2</b>
    content: >-
      To perform the taxonomic classification we will use Kraken2. This tool
      uses the minimizer method to sample the k-mers (all the read’s
      subsequences of length k) in a deterministic fashion in order to reduce
      memory constumption and processing time. In addition, it masks
      low-complexity sequences from reference sequences by using dustmasker.<br>

      Once we have assigned the corresponding taxa to the sequence, the next
      step is to properly visualize the data, for which we will use the Krona
      pie chart tool (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-385">Ondov
