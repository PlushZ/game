# Let's start the Game!

During a space exploration, Sam, a curious young alien robot from a faraway galaxy, discovered a little blue planet in the Milky Way. As he approached it, he saw that it was water on top of a rocky planet with an atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen. But wait, what are these little creatures everywhere? In the water, on the rocks and even flying in the atmosphere! In different shapes and sizes and they are even creating replicates of themselves! Is this called life? Sam had heard of life before but he thought it was a myth. 

Sam wants to self-replicate the kind of life of the earth on his planet. So he found out that the building plan seemed to be the DNA. It has the same building blocks in all organisms but somehow has different ways of implementing life. Sam would like to learn more about this differences.

Sam invites you to join him. He will guide you through the game and you learn about the Earth and life on it with him. Press the button to start.
